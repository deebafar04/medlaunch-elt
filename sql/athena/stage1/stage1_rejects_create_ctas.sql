/* ============================================================================
Stage 1 â€” Rejects (CTAS, Parquet, partitioned)

Purpose
  Persist rows that FAIL Stage-1 DQ rules so we can inspect and fix them later.

DQ rules (fail if any is true)
  - facility_id does NOT start with 'FAC' (case-insensitive)
  - facility_name is blank after TRIM
  - employee_count is NULL or negative
  - number_of_offered_services is negative (should never happen, but checked)

Output
  Table:  medlaunch_db.stage1_facility_metrics_rejects
  Files:  s3://medlaunch-elt-datalake-050451385876-us-east-1/
          silver-cleaned-stage1-parquet/stage1_facility_metrics_rejects/
  Format: PARQUET + SNAPPY, partitioned by snapshot_date
